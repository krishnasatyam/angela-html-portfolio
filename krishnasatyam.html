    My name consists of the name of two gods Krishna and Satyam.
<ul>
    <li>Krishna is one of the incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Aparently, the meaning of Krishna is the one who hypnotises everybody.</li>
    <li>Lord Shiva is often also called as Satyam. As he represents purity and unselfishness. However, satyam means truth.</li>
</ul>
